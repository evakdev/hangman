# TOEFL Hangman
A hangman game to practice writing readable code. 
I'm using classes and functions rather than a simple loop, to practice and maybe add other stuff to this later. 
Features of the game include: 
  - showing different messages in every run 
  - using TOEFL words
  - custom stickman I drew myself because why not :)

P.S. I've also included my old file as an example of bad code. 
     I'm not saying the final one is the best possible, but it's definitely better. 
     feel free to compare to see the differences!
