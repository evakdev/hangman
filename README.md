# TOEFL Hangman
A hangman game to practice writing readable code. 
I'm using classes and functions rather than a simple loop, to practice and maybe add other stuff to this later. 
Features of the game include: 
  - showing different messages in every run 
  - using TOEFL words
  - custom stickman I drew myself because why not :)
